# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes a large-scale hotel booking dataset (119,000 observations) to identify the key determinants of booking cancellations using econometric and statistical methods in R.

The objective was to combine economic reasoning with statistical modeling to understand customer cancellation behavior and assess data quality implications.

## Methods

* Data cleaning and preprocessing (R)
* Exploratory data analysis and visualization
* Hypothesis testing (Chi-square tests)
* Logistic regression with:

  * Interaction terms
  * Non-linear terms
* Model evaluation:

  * Multicollinearity diagnostics
  * Classification accuracy
* Missing data simulation:

  * MCAR (Missing Completely at Random)
  * MNAR (Missing Not at Random)
* Sensitivity analysis on model performance under data degradation

---

## Key Contributions

* Identified statistically significant predictors of cancellation behavior
* Demonstrated interaction effects between lead time and customer type
* Quantified model sensitivity to missing data mechanisms
* Reinforced importance of data integrity in applied econometric modeling

---

## Tools Used

* R
* dplyr
* ggplot2
* glm (logistic regression)
* Statistical testing frameworks

---

## Academic Context

Completed as part of graduate coursework in Data Analysis at Stony Brook University (Fall 2024).
